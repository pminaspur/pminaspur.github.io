I came to realize the significance of algorithms and data structures for effective problem-solving and enhancing software performance. Computer science professionals need to possess a deep knowledge of algorithms such as sorting, searching, and graph algorithms, alongside data structures including arrays, linked lists, and trees.<br/>

During my course working in the SDLC, algorithms and data structures, security vulnerabilities etc became increasingly important to solving problems efficiently and optimizing software performance. Computer scientists should have a solid understanding of algorithms like sorting, searching, and graph algorithms, as well as data structures like arrays, linked lists, and trees.
 It is that knowledge that brings gratitude and satisfaction when it is applied. Over the course of my study and professional career, I have developed and enhanced all of the above soft skills, as well as others such as creativity, communication, and time management. <br/>

Throughout my course, I focus on developing a strong combination of technical and soft skills.  It was helpful for me to learn about how the SDLC works by analysing, designing, coding (implementation), testing, and maintaining, a step that is crucial for delivering high-quality software products. This course taught me about algorithms, data structures, and security vulnerabilities, which have been extremely valuable for addressing challenges effectively and improving software performance. To succeed as a computer scientist, one must have a strong grasp of algorithms such as sorting, searching, and graphs, as well as data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and trees. <br/>

### _Refinement Plan and Code Review_

Code review is often referred to as a peer assessment of code, which helps developers ensure or improve code quality and identify and rectify errors that may have been missed during the initial development stage before integration and deployment. In other words, code reviews are a practice focused on maintaining software quality, wherein one or more individuals or tools methodically inspect and evaluate the program's source code. After a software developer completes coding, they can easily make mistakes. With this in mind, code reviews provide an excellent opportunity to gain a different perspective on the solutions and implementations, helping to identify bugs, logical errors, overlooked edge cases, or other concerns so we can collaboratively resolve them and prevent mistakes.<br/>

Code review videos feature an assessment of the three chosen artifact codes for the capstone project, focusing on their shortcomings and vulnerabilities, along with a description of my strategy for improvements.
The code review involves a detailed examination of the current source code, providing a concise overview of the project, its purpose, and what the application accomplishes. Following this, I assessed the provided checklist in relation to the existing source code, discussing its limitations and sharing my insights on the proposed enhancements across three categories: software design and engineering artifacts, algorithms and data structures, and databases.
Through the creation of these videos, I am enhancing my skills in professional communication across written, verbal, and visual channels. Furthermore, I am ensuring that my code review presentation is effectively communicated in a collaborative setting and expressing my ideas clearly. <br/>

In the artifact of the Code analysis, I illustrate the key components of: Current code and its operation: This segment examines the capabilities and performance of the current code. <br/>
Code Review: Highlight areas requiring improvement concerning structure, documentation, security, testing, loops, functionality, comments, etc. <br/>
Planned Improvements: This portion outlines intended enhancements that respond to the concerns identified in the code review.<br/>

### _Algorithms and Data Structure_

The code review for algorithms and data structures pertains to the Animal Shelter class. This program was planned, designed, and developed as part of the computer science curriculum, CS 340 Client-Server Development course. It aims to create a fully functional interactive web-based dashboard for the Grazioso animals training company, which specializes in identifying suitable dogs for their search and rescue training programs. The application is built using Python and the Dash framework, with MongoDB acting as its database. The connection between Python and MongoDB is established using the PyMongo driver, while Jupyter Notebook functions as a testing environment for the web application. The application is structured as a monolithic architecture, which limits its flexibility and scalability due to a tightly coupled codebase. I intend to decompose the code into smaller, individual services, ensuring that each service can be independently built, developed, and tested.
Additionally, I plan to utilize advanced operations, as the list will facilitate sorting algorithms like quicksort and binary search, which are beneficial for dynamic data in this complex application. With these enhancements, I aim to improve the data structures and algorithms of the Animal Shelter class, thereby boosting the overall performance and value of the system.

### _Databases_

Code reviews in databases are an artifact of the Grazioso Salvare Search for Rescue Web Application. This web application was developed as part of the CS340 Client-Server Development course. Leveraging a pre-existing database from animal shelters, the application identifies and classifies available dogs for training in various rescue programs by developing a web interface. The project utilizes MongoDB alongside the Dash framework within the Python application. Integration between MongoDB and Python is achieved through the PyMongo library. Assessments of the web application are performed using Jupyter Notebook. The planned enhancement is to utilize advanced features of MongoDB by setting up indexes on commonly queried attributes such as age, animal ID, type, and color. This will allow the database to efficiently find data quickly instead of scanning the whole table, facilitating considerable horizontal scalability without necessitating changes to the application logic. The data entered the database is not validated, making it vulnerable to security risks, so I plan to implement strict input validation as my second enhancement to the project. In addition, I intend to execute the operations entirely within the database using Aggregation pipelines, eliminating the need for extensive result sets to be transferred over the network. The third improvement I have made to the project is this one.
